<h1 align="center">Onboarding</h1> 

<p>Onboarding is a process that is continuously improved process. In order to quickly parse the neccessary information to build out both the Okta infrastructure and Oomnitza files I create a workspace for each Onboarding class</p>

1. mkdir ~/Onboarding/

2. mkdir ~/Onboarding/OnboardingMMDD

3. Moving into the current date Onboarding folder make files for each new hire ending in .txt

4. Using the onboarding_shipping_information.sh script to parse both Emails and Shipping information to have all the information in a single window.
